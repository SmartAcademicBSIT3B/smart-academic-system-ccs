# 📘 Smart Academic Management System (CCS)

## 📌 Project Overview

An Integrated Smart Academic Management System with Data Analytics for:

1. Thesis/Capstone Archiving and HTE
2. Faculty Requirement Submission
3. Class List and Student Violation Management
4. Laboratory Time-In/Out Monitoring

Built using **Electron.js, Node.js, and MySQL (XAMPP)**.

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- XAMPP (for MySQL database)

---

## 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmartAcademicBSIT3B/smart-academic-system-ccs.git
cd smart-academic-system-ccs
```

---

## 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

👉 This will install all required packages including Electron.

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

1. **Copy the environment template:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

1. **Configure your environment variables in `.env`:**

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_PASSWORD=your_supabase_password
```

1. **Fill in your actual credentials** (database and Supabase details)

⚠️ **Important:** Never commit the `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

# ⚠️ Windows PowerShell Fix (npm not working)

If you encounter this error:

```
npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```

This happens because PowerShell blocks script execution by default.

---

## ✅ Solution (Recommended)

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
2. Run the following command:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

1. Type:

```bash
Y
```

1. Restart your terminal

---

## ▶️ Then run again

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 🟡 Alternative (Temporary Fix)

If you don’t want to change system settings:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

👉 This only works for the current session

---

## 🟢 Alternative (Easiest)

You can also use:

- Command Prompt (cmd)
- Git Bash

Instead of PowerShell, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 🔐 Note

This is safe and commonly used for development.
It only allows locally created scripts to run.

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

👉 This will launch the Electron desktop app.

# 👨‍💻 Development Workflow

## 🔄 Pull Latest Changes

Before starting work:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 🌿 Create a Feature Branch

Each module should have its own branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/archive-module
```

Other examples:

3. Add description of your changes
4. Submit for review

---

## 🔁 Updating Your Branch

If main branch has updates:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/archive-module
git merge main
```
